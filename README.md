Youyue-858D+ MCU-adapter:
=========================

LAYOUT FILES: ATmega168/328 adapter board for the Youyue 858D+.  

[![Adapter front](/Docs/mockup.jpg)](/Docs/mockup.jpg)

The purpose if this little board is to add an ISP header and a convenient way of adding
more stuff via some TH solder pads.

The old MCU (ATmega8) is removed and replaced with a DIP28 socket (machined pins).
These same machined pins go into the bigger holes of the adapter board and form a
low-profile socket for the new MCU (ATmega168). The adapter board then plugs into
the socket on the main circuit board.

Before having PC-boards made, please make sure you know about your manufacturer's peculiarities!
Especially drill-sizes and their tolerances may vary too much and give you trouble.
